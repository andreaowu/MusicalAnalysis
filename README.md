Musical Roman-Numeral Analysis
====================

This is a music application that provides the Roman numeral analysis of a piece of music given the instrumental sheet music. It is being developed from the ground up using Music21: a toolkit for computer-aided musicology, which is based in Python. 

This application was developed as part of UC Berkeley's Music 159: Computer Programming for Music Applications for Spring 2014. 

To use:
	install Python and Music21
	command line: python core.py [insert piece of music]
	There is a list of available pieces of music here: http://web.mit.edu/music21/doc/systemReference/referenceCorpus.html
